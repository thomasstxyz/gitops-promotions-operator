# gitops-promotions-operator

The GitOps Promotions Operator watches Git Repositories (Environments) for changes,
and promotes them to other Environments.

## Getting Started

Create a `Environment` CR for your source environment.

```yaml
apiVersion: promotions.gitopsprom.io/v1alpha1
kind: Environment
metadata:
  name: dev
spec:
  path: ./envs/dev
  source:
    url: https://github.com/thomasstxyz/example-kustomize-overlay-dev
    ref:
      branch: main
```

> If it's a private repository, you must add `.spec.source.secretRef`
> and setup an ssh key pair explained at [Creating an ssh key pair](#creating-an-ssh-key-pair).

Create a `Environment` CR for your target environment.

```yaml
apiVersion: promotions.gitopsprom.io/v1alpha1
kind: Environment
metadata:
  name: prod
spec:
  path: ./envs/prod
  source:
    url: https://github.com/thomasstxyz/example-kustomize-overlay-prod
    ref:
      branch: main
    secretRef:
      name: prod-ssh
  apiTokenSecretRef:
    name: github-api-token
  gitProvider: github
```

`.spec.source.secretRef` references a secret which contains an ssh key pair,
follow [Creating an ssh key pair](#creating-an-ssh-key-pair) to set it up.

`.spec.apiTokenSecretRef` references a secret which contains an API Token for the git provider
(GitHub), with permissions to create Pull Requests. This secret can be created with the following command:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic github-api-token --from-literal=token="ghp_n139N..."
```

Create a `Promotion` CR.

```yaml
apiVersion: promotions.gitopsprom.io/v1alpha1
kind: Promotion
metadata:
  name: from-dev-to-prod
spec:
  sourceEnvironmentRef:
    name: dev
  targetEnvironmentRef:
    name: prod
  copy:
  - name: "Application Version"
    source: app-version
    target: app-version
  - name: "Kustomization File"
    source: ./app-version/kustomization.yaml
    target: ./app-version/
  - name: "Application Settings"
    source: settings
    target: settings
  strategy: pull-request
```

Now if there are changes in the source environment,
which differ from the target environment,
the operator will create a pull request.

## Creating an ssh key pair

Generate an RSA key pair for SSH auth.

```bash
ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa -f key -q -C gitopsprombot -N ""
GITOPSPROMBOT_PRIVATE_KEY=$(cat key)
GITOPSPROMBOT_PUBLIC_KEY=$(cat key.pub)
```

Create a Secret.

```bash
kubectl create secret generic prod-ssh \
--from-literal=private=${GITOPSPROMBOT_PRIVATE_KEY} \
--from-literal=public=${GITOPSPROMBOT_PUBLIC_KEY}
```

The public key needs to be configured as a "deploy key" in the Git Repository.
**If you want to promote to this environment, the deploy key needs write permissions!**
```bash
cat key.pub
```
> Docs about how to configure a deploy key:
> - [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/managing-deploy-keys)

When applied to the cluster, you should delete the key from your local machine.

```bash
rm key
rm key.pub
```

## Description
// TODO(user): An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/gitops-promotions-operator:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/gitops-promotions-operator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
